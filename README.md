# Litecoin Farming Bot

This project is an advanced automation bot for interacting with Telegram reward bots like `Litecoin_click_bot`. It automates tasks such as visiting websites, messaging other bots, and joining Telegram channels to complete tasks and earn rewards.

## Features

### 1. **Website Surfing Automation**
   - Simulates visiting websites through a headless browser using `undetected_chromedriver`.
   - Detects and handles CAPTCHA challenges or Cloudflare protections.
   - Efficiently retrieves and processes task URLs from Telegram messages.

### 2. **Message Bots**
   - Automates messaging other bots as part of reward tasks.
   - Extracts bot usernames and interacts with them via the Telegram API.
   - Handles message validation and forwards the required response back to the reward bot.

### 3. **Join Channels**
   - Automatically joins Telegram channels using the `JoinChannelRequest` method from the Telegram API.
   - Verifies task completion by interacting with the reward bot.

### 4. **Cycle Management**
   - Executes tasks in a loop, seamlessly switching between surfing, messaging, and joining tasks.
   - Includes delay mechanisms to mimic natural user behavior and avoid detection.

## Technical Stack

- **Telegram API**: Interaction with Telegram bots and accounts using the `telethon` library.
- **Selenium & Undetected Chromedriver**: For headless browser automation, bypassing bot detection systems.
- **Regex Matching**: Extracting task URLs and bot usernames efficiently.
- **Asyncio**: Ensuring non-blocking, asynchronous execution for optimal performance.
- **Colorama**: For enhanced console output with colored text.

## How It Works

1. The bot logs in to your Telegram account using `telethon` with your API credentials.
2. It interacts with the specified reward bot (`Litecoin_click_bot`) by sending task commands like:
   - `ðŸ–¥ Visit sites`
   - `ðŸ¤– Message bots`
   - `/join`
3. The bot parses the task details from the botâ€™s responses, processes the tasks, and returns results to the reward bot.
4. Handles challenges such as CAPTCHA or invalid URLs gracefully with retry mechanisms.
